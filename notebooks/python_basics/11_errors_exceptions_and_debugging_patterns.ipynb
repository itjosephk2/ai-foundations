    "# 11 — Errors, Exceptions & Debugging Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Get comfortable with how Python fails, how to read error messages, and how to handle exceptions without turning your code into a try/except soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recognising common error types (SyntaxError, TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, KeyError, etc.)\n",
    "- Reading tracebacks so you know **where** and **why** things blew up\n",
    "- Using `try` / `except` / `finally` / `raise` in a controlled way\n",
    "- Adopting a few simple debugging habits (print-style debugging, small repros, isolating functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim isn’t to avoid errors — it’s to **use them as information** instead of getting stuck or randomly poking at the code.\n"
